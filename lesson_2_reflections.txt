What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
appears a repository for me using as version-control, to tell the computer, this file is my git repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it’s more like a buffer zone, which facilitate users to commit a lot of files one time, so as to reduce the difficulty of commit files one by one 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
use git diff —-staged to see if I commit once per logical change.
